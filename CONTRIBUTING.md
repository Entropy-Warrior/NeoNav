# Contributing

If you really want to reinvent the wheel with me and actually need a wheel, contributions are welcome.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- Follow Swift conventions
- Use `@MainActor` for UI code
- Prefer `async/await`
- Keep it simple

Be respectful and constructive - but most of all, have fun and be kind!
